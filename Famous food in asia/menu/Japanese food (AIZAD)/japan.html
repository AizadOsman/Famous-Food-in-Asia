<p>Japan is not only a country famous for the technological advances developed by its people, but Japan is also famous

<h4>1/10</h4> <h2>Sushi</h2>
<p>Sushi is a Japanese word that refers to any food produced with rice vinegar and seasoned with it. When we think of
Japanese cuisine, it's one of the first things that comes to mind. It is a Japanese dish consisting of tiny pieces of
raw fish wrapped in rice and seaweed. Sushi is now mass-produced using machines, yet good sushi is still made by hand.
Sushi is available at Japanese restaurants such as Sushi King, Sakae Sushi, and even Family Mart in Malaysia.<br><p>
