# Famous-Food-in-Asia
My first attempt at developing a website from scratch using HTML. This website showcases the famous food that can be found in a few Asia countries, like Thailand, Malaysia, Korea, and Japan. This site also featured a Live Clock, which was embedded from the <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/">timeanddate</a> website. A feedback page was also included on the site as a way to gain feedback to improve the overall website performance. This feedback will be sent through email.

Guide to access the project:
1. Download the file "Famous Food in Asia.rar".
2. Unzip or extract the files.
3. Open the folder "Famous Food in Asia" 
4. Click the HTML file "main page".
5. Voila!
